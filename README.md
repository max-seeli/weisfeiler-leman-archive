# Weisfeiler Leman Archive
The project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test, focusing on its potential limitations and the existence of counterexamples. The website serves as an interactive portal where users can explore detailed examples of graph collisions identified by the WL test, including visual representations and technical descriptions.

## Website Features

The website serves as an interactive portal where users can:

- **Explore Collisions**: View detailed examples of graph collisions identified by the WL test, including visual representations and technical descriptions.
- **Understand the WL Test** (upcoming): Access resources and explanations about the WL graph isomorphism test, its significance, and its limitations.
- **Interactive Tools** (upcoming): Utilize web-based tools to apply the WL test on custom graphs, observing potential collisions firsthand.

Visit the website at [https://max-seeli.github.io/weisfeiler-leman-archive/](https://max-seeli.github.io/weisfeiler-leman-archive/) to start exploring.

## Code Repository

This repository is split into two major parts. The source code used for finding WL test collisions is located in the `src` directory, while the website content is stored in the `docs` directory. 

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages: `networkx`, `matplotlib` (for graph visualization)
